# 🧶 LoopedByKlayd: Crochet Arts & Crafts E-Commerce

This project is the official e-commerce website for **LoopedByKlayd**, a small business specializing in handcrafted crochet goods, built with **React** and **React-Bootstrap**.

## 🌟 Business Context & Goal

**LoopedByKlayd** creates high-quality, unique crochet items like **plushies, flowers, and keychains**, and accepts custom commissions.

### Project Rationale (Why the Website?)

The client currently operates via Instagram ([https://www.instagram.com/loopedbyklayd/](https://www.instagram.com/loopedbyklayd/)). The website is necessary for:

1.  **Professionalism & Trust:** Establishing a secure and credible online storefront.
2.  **E-commerce Functionality:** Implementing proper **cart, checkout, and inventory management**, which Instagram cannot handle.
3.  **Streamlined Commissions:** Providing a dedicated, structured form for custom requests.
4.  **SEO & Discovery:** Improving visibility for customers searching for products outside of social media.

## 💻 Project Routes & Screens

The application uses the `Layout` component for consistent structure across major pages.

  * `/`: **HomeScreen** - Landing page featuring products, banner, and collection overview.
  * `/shop`: **ProductCatalogScreen** - View all products with filtering/sorting.
  * `/product/:id`: **ProductDetailScreen** - Specific item details, images, and "Add to Cart."
  * `/commissions`: **CommissionRequestScreen** - Dedicated form for submitting custom order requests.
  * `/cart`: **CartScreen** - Review items, adjust quantities, and proceed to checkout.
  * `/login`: **LoginScreen** - User sign-in/registration (uses a simple, non-3-column layout).

## 🛠️ Technical Setup

The project uses **Create React App**.
